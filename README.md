# CIS-277 Data Structures & Algorithms
Some projects and problems from CIS-277. Feel free to add, edit and post your own. 

#Tour

* **Group Projects**  will be contained along with any supplementary files or pseudocode in their own folder. The folders will serve as a final version of the projects and any optimizations should be added to them there. 

* **Individual Projects** can be voluntarily added to the folders named after them. Always contain proper attribution. 

* **Side Projects** will live in the *Side Projects* folder. Please check it out. 

*  If you had an idea for a side project but ~~are too lazy~~ dont feel like doing all the heavy work, throw it in their and we will try to contribute to it and build something awesome, even if its just an idea that you have.

### Other Notes

* **Exam-Notes** will hold notes and pre-exam reviews.


* When you upload an **Individual Project**, add  `-yourname`to the end so we can easily see who's code belongs to who.
