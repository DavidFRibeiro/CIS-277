# CIS-277 Data Structures and Algorithms

Some projects and problems from CIS-277. Feel free to add, edit and post your own. 

#Tour

* **Group Projects**  will be contained along with any supplementary files or pseudocode in their own folder. The folders will serve as a final version of the projects and any optimizations should be added to them there. 

* **Individual Projects** can be voluntarily added to the folders named after them. Always contain proper attribution. 

* **Side Projects** will live in the *Side Projects* folder. Please check it out. 

*  If you had an idea for a side project but ~~are too lazy~~ dont feel like doing all the heavy work, throw it in their and we will try to contribute to it and build something awesome, even if its just an idea that you have.

#Contribute!

 If you still havent contributed or done anything on the repo, it may be because it isnt clear how to. Its easy!

1. Get the GitHub Desktop Application, and log in with your account.

2. In the browser or from the program itself make a local clone of the repo. There's a button for this on the repo itself. 

3. When you want to add something or make a change, create a branch and name it something relevent to your change like "Add-Side-Project", "Fix-Matt's-Bug", "Leverage-Frank's-Limitless-Genius".

4. Make your changes or additions to the cloned repository. The GitHub Desktop App should then show the differences you made and allow you to write in a Summary and Description. 

5. You commit the changes to your Branch and once your Branch is ready to be pulled into the main Repo, send a pull request. 

6. **Be happy**.

### Other Notes

* **Exam-Notes** will hold notes and pre-exam reviews.

* When you upload an **Individual Project**, add  `-yourname`to the end so we can easily see who's code belongs to who.
